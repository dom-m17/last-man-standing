package graphmodels

// Having this file is a workaround to be able to generate code using v0.16.0.
// See https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen/issues/1849

// While this file is empty, it could be removed by omitting the 'autobind' field in gqlgen
// However I want to keep this in case I ever want to define any universal types
